## What is this?

**No Scroll** is a Visual Studio Code extension that makes **breakpoints useful** for navigation.

Have you ever been scrolling up and down on the one file just to read the same method or block of code over and over while losing your previous spot?

Well now you can warp to breakpoints set in any file with the commands below.
