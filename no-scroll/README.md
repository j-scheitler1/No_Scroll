# 🧭 No Scroll

## 🛠️ What is this?

**No Scroll** is a Visual Studio Code extension that makes **breakpoints actually useful** for navigation.

You know how you carefully sprinkle breakpoints all over your code, like digital breadcrumbs… only to never use them again unless you're debugging?

Well, guess what? **Now you can teleport to them.**  
Think of this as your personal wormhole generator for breakpoints.

We believe breakpoints should be more than tiny red dots.  
They should **take you places**.

## 🧪 Why Should I Use This?

Because scrolling is for peasants.

You already marked the important lines in your file using breakpoints. Why not *use* them like bookmarks from the future?

Give your mouse a break. Give your fingers a reason to stay on the keyboard.
